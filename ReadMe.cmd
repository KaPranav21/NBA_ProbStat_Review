NBA Statistics Review
Overview
This project serves as a personal review of NBA (National Basketball Association) statistics using Python and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset used contains information about NBA players, including their names, teams, age, height, weight, college, draft details, and performance statistics (e.g., points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game).

Files
nba_data.csv: CSV file containing the NBA dataset used for analysis.
nba_statistics.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.
